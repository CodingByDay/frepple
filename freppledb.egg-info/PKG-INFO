# frePPLe

## Open source supply chain planning

FrePPLe is an easy-to-use and easy-to-implement open source **demand forecasting** and
**advanced planning and scheduling** tool for manufacturing companies.

When spreadsheets doesn't suffice any longer to adequately plan and schedule your production, frePPLe allows an easy and cost-efficient way to generate a more optimized plan.

FrePPLe implements time series forecasting algorithms to analyze the sales history and compute the forecasted sales for the future.

FrePPLe implements production planning and scheduling algorithms based on best practices such as **theory of constraints** (ie *plan around the bottleneck*), **pull-based planning** (ie *start production as late as possible and directly triggered by demand*) and **lean manufacturing** (ie *avoid intermediate delays and inventory*).
